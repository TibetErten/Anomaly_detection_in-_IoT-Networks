# Hybrid CNN-Transformer for IDS in IoT Networks

The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems across critical sectors has introduced new
vulnerabilities in network infrastructures, demanding smarter and more adaptive
cybersecurity solutions. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) either fail to
detect novel threats or suffer from high false positive rates due to outdated models and
class imbalance in datasets.
This thesis proposes a hybrid deep learning-based IDS framework tailored for IoT
networks. By leveraging the spatial processing strengths of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and the sequential pattern recognition capabilities of Transformers,
this research aims to significantly enhance the detection accuracy of both frequent and
rare cyberattacks in heterogeneous IoT environments. The study will also incorporate
feature engineering and data balancing techniques to optimize model performance and
generalizability.

# Objectives:
The aim of this thesis is to design and evaluate a machine learning-based Intrusion
Detection System for IoT networks that improves upon current detection mechanisms in
terms of accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. The specific objectives
include:
• Investigating deep learning architectures suitable for processing heterogeneous
IoT traffic data.
• Designing a CNN-Transformer hybrid model for robust intrusion detection.
• Implementing data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to enhance
model efficiency.
• Addressing dataset class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE.
• Evaluating the model using IOT_ids datasets and comparing it with
existing IDS benchmarks
